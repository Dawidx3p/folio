            <h2>Courses & Schools</h2>
            <h3>Front End Engineer Career Path at Codecademy</h3>
            <p>350 hour course, 71 Projects, 121 Lessons</p>
            <br>
            <h3>JS, React, Redux for programmers at Coderslab</h3>
            <p>I've had a great 130 hours of improving my React/Redux skills.
                Learned a lot about the Ecosystem and how to manage it. 
                I've also gained understanding of good coding practices.
                Ready to use my knowledge on a daily basis</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Graphic Design & Multimedia</h3>
            <p>Undergraduate studies, that prepare for work in the broadly 
                understood field of applied graphics, as well as for master’s 
                studies. The core courses, which are compulsory for everyone, 
                cover the essential theoretical knowledge and practical skills
                that a modern designer needs to succeed in the design industry. 
                Students learn not only the key skills in software, but also the basics 
                of visual language: its grammar, tools, purposes and the ways 
                in which it can be used. This means not only being fluent in 
                Illustrator, Photoshop, and After Effects, but also understanding 
                how visual language is read by other people and how it is 
                used in business, politics, and our daily social life. 
                The core courses also include photography and drawing. </p>
                <br>
            <p class="bold">Digital & Interaction Design specialization</p>
            <p>Focused on graphics that can be viewed on a screen. 
                The projects were mainly related to film and animation, but also 
                UX and UI design of applications and websites. In addition to digital 
                image and sound processing, I also created storyboards and my 
                own movies. I used Adobe Premiere, After Effects and other software. 
                I improved my digital photography skills.</p>
